I'm using this project for my first project because it's simple and small.  I was playing around with Shoes (which is a GUI builder for Ruby).  Don't expect anything exciting.  When you start the app, it takes a snapshot of the time.  When you 'open the box', Ruby checks to see if the cat is dead.  I found the project neat because, much like the actual theory, nobody (not even Ruby) knows if the cat is dead while the box is closed.  I learned a few things from this project.  First, Ruby is really fun and easy to use.  Second, I completely misunderstood Schrödinger's Cat.  The cat doesn't have a greater chance to die the longer it's in the box (as I originally thought), the cat just has a 50-50 chance of being dead or alive.  Since this would make my 'app' really simplistic, I never bothered updating it.  NOTE: No actual cats were harmed in the making of this project.  Also, I don't advocate harming animals.
