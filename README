I'm using this project for my first project because it's simple and small.  I was playing around with Shoes (which is a GUI builder for Ruby).

Don't expect anything exciting.

I learned a few things from this project.  First, Ruby is really fun and easy to use.  Second, I completely misunderstood Schrödinger's Cat.  The cat
doesn't have a greater chance to die the longer it's in the box (as I originally thought), the cat just has a 50-50 chance of being dead or alive.
Since this would make my 'app' really simplistic, I never bothered updating it.

NOTE: No actual cats were harmed in the making of this project.  Also, I don't advocate harming animals.
